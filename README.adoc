# Conference Me web application


### Introduction
An example which shows how to use Camel routing to integrate with API servers, to host a REST API proxy and to bundle a standalone web application. Key design elements -

- Servlet web application http://localhost:8080/conference using bootstrap and mustache to render a table of sessions
- REST API http://localhost:8080/conference/rest/sessions built on Camel Rest DSL for the View Model for the web page
- Inbuilt integration routing using Camel routing as a connector for https://apicandidates.developer.azure-api.net/ APIs
- JAXB XSD to API model generation 
- Swagger for Rest APIs http://localhost/conference/rest/api-docs
- JUnits for testing integration routes
- Bundled Postman test suite for functional testing

### Build
You will need to package this example first:

	cd conference
	mvn package

### Prerequisites

	Install JDK 9+
	Install Maven

### Unit tests

Integration routes can be tested via maven

	mvn test

Once deployed, REST APIs and Swagger can be tested via Postman tests in the project source
    
    VirginMoney.postman_collection.json

### Run

To run the example

	mvn jetty:run

And then hit this url from a web browser

<http://localhost:8080/conference>
